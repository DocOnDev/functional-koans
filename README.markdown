# Functional Koans

### About the Koans

There are several functional languages that have contributed their own
versions of the koans.  Each language has it's own branch with
detailed instructions on how to get started.

### Getting Started

To download the dependencies, install leiningen
(http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). After you have leiningen
installed run 

`lein deps`

which will download all dependencies you need to run the clojure koans.

### Running The Koans

To run the koans, simply run

lein run
